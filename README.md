This is a repo for learning git
This is a change made, did it work?-This was VS Code change
This change is via terminal, did this work? (used VIM and folder name and it opened for me to edit after type i-then was able to arrow down and add stuff). - when done hit 'esc' to leave insert mode and the ':w' for wrting change or ':x' for saving and exiting. Then hit enter and execute command.
